                                <p>Perhaps the most feared predator in the world, the great white shark truly is the king of the oceans, and thanks to movies such as Jaws is generally feared – and even hated – by humans. These sharks are at the top of the food chain, though they may be considered a controversial pick for this list of apex predators as they sometimes fall prey to orcas and other, larger great white sharks. They hunt their prey by targeting them with a small bump, then circling to return to the prey, swimming with their mouths open and ready to attack. Little is known about their social behaviour, though evidence suggests they’re largely solitary animals, residing within territorial waters and feeding areas, but also undertaking long inter-continental voyages.

                                <p><b>"KILLER WHALE"</b>. Why are orcas called 'killer whales' when they are dolphins? Dolphins and whales are closely related. Orcas were given the name 'killer whale' by ancient sailors' observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. It is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas; they are absent only from the Baltic and Black seas, and some areas of the Arctic Ocean. The great white shark is no match for an orca. Killer whales are apex predators, which means they have no natural predators. They hunt in packs, much like wolves, which are also at the top of their food chain.
